 In this research, we consider an optimization problem for allocation and dispatching emergency vehicles (EVs). We propose an optimization model which considers the integration dispatch of EVs in a comparatively large area. We generated some random scenarios to deal with uncertainty in the real world and conducted numerical experiments. However, the obtained results showed that the usefulness of the model is very limited. Therefore, we modified the model to fix the allocation of EVs and the modified model can find the optimal or nearly optimal dispatch under the fixed allocation. (585 characters)
